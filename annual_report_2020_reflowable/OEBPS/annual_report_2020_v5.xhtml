			<p class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1"><span class="CharOverride-11">Dear friends,</span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1"><span class="CharOverride-8">I hope this message finds you well. It has been a challenging year, and certainly not the one I envisioned as I, along with so many others, looked forward to our first year in a brand new library building. </span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1"><span class="CharOverride-8">As you may know, we opened the new Charles Library on Temple’s Main Campus last August. There was much excitement around this dynamic, inspiring new space, as well as a share of media interest and acclaim. But more importantly, after its grand debut, Charles Library became a beacon, drawing in students, faculty, staff, and visitors from around the city, region, and country through its doors and up through its four, light-filled floors. </span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1"><span class="CharOverride-8">But, like for all of us, the COVID-19 pandemic changed things. From March until August, our library buildings were closed and we shifted much of our work online. It was—to be honest—disheartening to see such a magnificent building as Charles standing empty.</span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1"><span class="CharOverride-8">Yet, we all know a library is about so much more than its physical presence. In the midst of upheaval, our library staff moved quickly to provide much-needed, remote services and resources. You will read more about that work in this report.</span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1"><span class="CharOverride-8">This report also highlights initiatives, projects, and accomplishments of the past fiscal year, from new special collections acquisitions and titles published by Temple University Press to major news items, staff achievements, and library statistics. </span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1"><span class="CharOverride-8">I’m proud of the work we’ve done during this time, and I also look toward the future with hope. If this experience has taught us anything, it’s that resilience is one of our greatest strengths. </span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1"><span class="CharOverride-8">Thank you for taking the time to read about our year at the Libraries. Your continuing interest in and support of our work is truly appreciated, and I wish you health and safety as we navigate this new territory together.</span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1"><span class="CharOverride-8">With warm regards,</span></p>

			<p class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1"><span class="CharOverride-13">In August 2019, we celebrated the opening of the new Charles Library on Temple’s Main Campus. This new building boldly envisions the future of academic libraries, and is a powerful testament to Temple’s commitment to teaching and learning.</span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1"><span class="CharOverride-13">As we prepared our 2019 Annual Report, we were already looking forward to the 2020 issue, when we could share stories from our first year in Charles Library with you. But that first year was interrupted in March 2020, when Temple moved classes fully online in an effort to keep the Temple community safe and to slow the spread of COVID-19. Charles Library, along with all our other library locations, was closed to the public until August of this year.</span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1"><span class="CharOverride-13">Despite these very challenging circumstances, we remained committed to serving our patrons and providing important resources and services even as our physical locations were closed. Library staff worked quickly to offer expanded access to online journals and databases, moved workshops and reference consultations online, contributed to a universitywide taskforce to produce PPE for Temple University Hospital, created tutorials and other online learning resources, and more. </span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1"><span class="CharOverride-13">As you read this report, Charles Library is open once more. We have enacted a variety of measures to ensure the safety of our visitors and staff at Charles and all our libraries, and we will continue to adapt and persevere in the coming months. In the meantime, we are grateful for this opportunity to share with you a few of our favorite memories from this first year in Charles and to celebrate some of the spaces, features, and people that make it such a special place. </span></p>

			<p class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1"><span class="CharOverride-13">Situated in the heart of Main Campus, Charles Library (affectionately referred to as </span><span class="CharOverride-13">“the Charles”) is an inviting space where students, faculty, staff, and members of the community want to gather. Prior to the campus closures related to COVID-19, groups on and off campus reserved spaces for meetings, while the university used Charles Library as a site for many universitywide events, including Experience Temple Day and the faculty and staff holiday gathering.</span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1"><span class="CharOverride-13">Charles Library’s main service point is the One Stop Assistance desk. Located on the first floor, this bustling spot is now the main point of contact for library users on Main Campus. There, we help users find and check out materials, connect with a subject librarian, or point people in the right direction.</span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1"><span class="CharOverride-13">During the fall and first part of the spring semester, you’d most often find the building busy with activity, from ongoing art installations to pop up concerts in the atrium to guided tours throughout the building. Not to mention all the open study areas and reservable study rooms where students and faculty were working independently or in groups.</span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1"><span class="CharOverride-13">The building’s outdoor spaces proved to be popular spots for collaborations, from our work with the Free Library of Philadelphia to sign visitors up for library cards outside the 13th Street entrance to a Mercury in transit viewing hosted by the College of Science and Technology on the fourth floor terrace. </span></p>

A unique domed atrium opens up views throughout the building and acts as a wayfinding device. An oculus draws you up to the light-filled fourth floor, where open stacks are flanked by study rooms and quiet reading areas, while a glazed window at the third floor, cut into the warm wooden dome, provides a point of introspection, looking out over the sun-drenched lobby and to the campus beyond. </span></p>

			<p class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1"><span class="CharOverride-13">One of Charles Library’s most unique features is its Automated Storage and Retrieval </span><span class="CharOverride-13">System, which we call the BookBot. The BookBot houses the majority of our general collection and a portion of SCRC archives in high density storage bins. This allows more room for people, flexible spaces, services, and other resources throughout the building. </span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1"><span class="CharOverride-13">To retrieve books, patrons can search on our website and “order” books that are located in the BookBot. A robotic arm retrieves and delivers their orders to a library staff member. We still have a browsing collection of approximately 180,000 books located on the fourth floor.</span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1"><span class="CharOverride-13">At Charles Library, flexible space means mobile technology. Temple students, faculty, and staff can check out laptops and portable battery chargers from kiosks located on each floor and then return them to any kiosk in the library or across campus.</span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1"><span class="CharOverride-13">Another innovative space is on the third floor of Charles: the Loretta C. Duckworth Scholars Studio. Formerly the Digital Scholarship Center in Paley Library, the Duckworth Scholars Studio is a hub for cutting-edge creativity and collaboration, housing a variety of VR equipment, 3D printers, a Makerspace, high-end computing, and more. Duckworth Scholars Studio staff also host a variety of workshops and events, including a tabletop gaming series. </span></p>

			<p class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1"><span class="CharOverride-18">For the first time ever, the Temple University Press office </span><span class="CharOverride-18">is now located in our Main Campus library. Known for publishing award-winning titles in the social sciences and the humanities, as well as regional titles, the Press is also involved in a variety of open access initiatives. Its new central location at Charles offers more opportunities for connection and collaboration and signals the Libraries’ and Press’ shared commitment to advancing scholarship.</span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1"><span class="CharOverride-18">Charles Library is also the new home of the Student Success Center (SSC), the university’s comprehensive, “one-stop-shop” academic support center serving graduate and undergraduate students. The center offers a wide range of services, including academic coaching, STEM and writing tutoring, as well as help for students who are developing a knowledge of English or other languages. The new SSC location makes it easier for students to access multiple services in one spot. </span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1"><span class="CharOverride-18">Another important space in Charles Library is the Special Collections Research Center (SCRC). The SCRC is the principal repository for and steward of the Libraries’ rare books, manuscripts, archives, and University records, and its upgraded facilities in Charles Library include the Albert M. Greenfield Special Collections Research Center Reading Room, a dedicated instruction room, a conservation lab, a rare book vault, and compact shelving.</span></p>

Perhaps most </span><span class="CharOverride-18">noticeable is the massive green roof, which covers approximately 70% of the building’s roof surface and is one of the largest in Pennsylvania. Visible from many vantage points on the fourth floor, this meadow-like landscape is filled with ornamental grasses, perennials, groundcovers, bulbs, and sedums that are all native or naturalized to the region and provide a rich urban habitat for pollinators. The green roof also collects and stores most precipitation, which along with underground basins, mitigates the impact on the City’s stormwater system. </span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1"><span class="CharOverride-18">Charles was also designed to use less heating and cooling energy, and large glass windows reduce the need for artificial lighting during daylight hours. All the wood inside the building has been certified by the Forest Stewardship Council, while all the toilets and sinks in Charles meet low water usage requirements.</span></p>

Duckworth Scholars Studio in Charles Library, Ross used 3D printers, laser cutters, and other equipment in our Makerspace to create and produce molds and face shields as part of this important project. Ross and his collaborators took a unique approach to PPE creation: rather than 3D printing the masks themselves, they printed molds out of which face shields could be cast. This process saved time and created equipment that could be reused. For a time, Ross was the only library staff member working out of Charles Library.</span></p>

			<p class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-1"><span class="CharOverride-13">Where Black people live has long been an important determinant of their ability</span><span class="CharOverride-13"> to participate in political processes. In addition to its social and economic impacts, the Great Migration significantly changed the way Democratic Party elites interacted with Black communities in the northern cities of Detroit, New York, and Chicago. Many white Democratic politicians came to believe the growing pool of Black voters could help them reach their electoral goals and these Black migrants built coalitions with local parties as they became politically active. By focusing on the Great Migration’s significant political consequences for U.S. cities, Grant goes where few scholars have gone before and lays the groundwork for ways of thinking about the contemporary impact of Black migration on American politics.</span></p>

That was the question posed by the curators, artists, scholars, and students who comprise the Philadelphia-based public art and history studio Monument Lab.
